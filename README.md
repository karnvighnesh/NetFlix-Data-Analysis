# Project Overview

In this case study, I analyzed a comprehensive dataset of Netflix's global content catalog, which includes detailed information about over 10,000 movies and TV shows. The objective was to uncover data-driven insights that can help Netflix decide which types of shows or movies to produce in the future and identify strategies to expand its business in different countries.



# Buisness Problem

Netflix aims to understand what type of content resonates in different regions and how it can optimize its content strategy to grow its subscriber base globally. The goal was to recommend actionable steps based on data analysis rather than intuition.



# Key Analysis & Approach
Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, converted data types appropriately, and un-nested complex columns (such as cast, director, and country).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Distribution of movies vs TV shows.

Trends in content release over the years.

Genre and content availability across different countries.

Analysis of ratings, durations, and release patterns.

Insights into the most frequent actors and directors.

Visual Analysis:

Created histograms, boxplots, countplots, and distplots to understand content characteristics.

Analyzed relationships between type, country, genre, and release year.

Insights & Recommendations:

Identified regional content preferences.

Found trends showing growing focus on TV shows in recent years.

Suggested optimal release periods and potential genre opportunities in under-served markets.


# Business Impact & Recommendations

Focus on region-specific genres: Invest in genres popular in target countries to increase engagement.

Expand TV show production: As user interest shifts toward episodic content, prioritize high-quality series.

Leverage popular actors and directors: Collaborations with frequent top-performing talent can drive viewership.

Seasonal launch strategy: Align new releases with optimal periods based on observed viewer trends.
